## Holistic Detection with `mediapipe` and OpenCV

This Python script demonstrates real-time holistic (full-body) detection using the **mediapipe** library and **OpenCV**. It captures video from the default camera, processes each frame to detect and visualize facial landmarks, hand landmarks (both left and right), and body pose landmarks.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- Install required packages: `mediapipe`, `opencv-python`

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd your-repository
  

3. Run the script:
    python your_script_name.py


### Controls

- Press '**Q**' to exit the program.

### Dependencies

- [`mediapipe`](https://github.com/google/mediapipe): A library by Google for in-browser real-time hand and pose detection.
- [`opencv-python`](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/): A computer vision library for image and video processing.

### Acknowledgments

- This project uses the **mediapipe** library for holistic detection.
- Special thanks to the **OpenCV** community for their contributions to computer vision.
